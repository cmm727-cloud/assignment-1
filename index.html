   <h1>Nutella® Brownies</h1> 
   <p>These moist, fudgy brownies started out as an impromptu experiment when I realized
too late I was out of baking chocolate. Now it's one of my favorite brownie
recipes! The Nutella® and Frangelico® give them a distinctly nutty flavor without
interrupting the smooth texture. I love these brownies with cold milk or hot
coffee.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>½ cup butter
<li>¼ cup hazelnut liqueur (such as Frangelico®)/
<li>¼ cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®), or more to taste
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
<li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
<ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan
or line with parchment paper.</p>
